// customerId: Number, representing the unique ID of the customer.
// amount: Number, representing the amount of the transaction.
// date: String, representing the date of the transaction (in the format "YYYY-MM-DD").

// averageTransactionAmount: Average amount of transactions.
// transactionsPerDay: An object where keys are dates and values are arrays containing transactions made on that date.

const transactions = [
    { customerId: 1, amount: 100, date: '2024-03-01' },
    { customerId: 2, amount: 150, date: '2024-03-01' },
    { customerId: 1, amount: 200, date: '2024-03-02' },
    { customerId: 3, amount: 50, date: '2024-03-02' },
    { customerId: 2, amount: 120, date: '2024-03-03' }
